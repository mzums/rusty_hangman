# Rusty Hangman
<img src="image.png" width="350">  

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game written in Rust. The program generates a random word and allows the player to guess letters within a limited number of chances.


## Features
- **Random word generation** using the random_word crate.
- Displays hidden letters as underscores (_) to represent the word.
- Tracks the player's guesses and updates the word with correct letters.
- Limits the number of incorrect guesses to 7 attempts.
- Displays appropriate messages for correct guesses, incorrect guesses, victory, or defeat.
  
  
## How It Works üì¢
1. A random word is generated at the start of the game.
2. The player is shown the word in a hidden form, where each letter is replaced by _.
3. The player inputs one letter at a time.
    - If the guessed letter exists in the word, it is revealed in its appropriate position(s).
    - If the guessed letter does not exist in the word, the player loses one of their 7 chances.
4. The game ends when:
    - The player guesses the entire word correctly.
    - The player uses all 7 chances without guessing the word.
